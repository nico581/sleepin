                      <p>As an influencer and a student, 21-year-old Nicoline has a busy everyday life. Balancing her studies at Copenhagens school of Design and technology, while maintaining an influencer career on Instagram, requires plenty of strategic focus.

                      <p>Nicoline’s health took a drastic turn during her exam period. Unable to stay concentrated and feeling tired throughout the day were two of the main issues. Her 3’rd semester exam was coming up. Right when she needed her head and body to stay in harmony the most, everything shut down.</p>

                      <p>“One day I was browsing through Spotify’s playlist to find one that would keep me focused. I stumbled upon Sleepin’ playlist “Off to Dreamland” and I finally understood what I was missing. My full 7-8 hour sleep. My head calmed down more than ever before, I was about to fall asleep at the library. I didn’t work a lot that day. I went home and put myself to bed at 20:00” </p>
                      <p>The majority of health authorities around the world recommend eating fruits, greens, plenty of fibers, and exercising. But somehow, sleep tends to be forgotten on that list.</p>
